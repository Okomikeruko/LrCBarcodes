# Lightroom Classic Barcode Reader Plug-in 

This plugin is an attempt to recreate the 
[LR Barcodes](https://www.capturemonkey.com/barcodes/) 
plugin that was developed and distributed by 
[Capture Monkey](https://capturemonkey.com) 
but reportedly hasn't been updated since 2017.

This plugin became an integral part of my company's operations 
with bulk image renaming, and with Adobe having just released 
[Lightroom Classic 12.0.1](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html)
it was essential that a new version be built.

Included in this repo is the raw `.LrDevPlugin` file that essencially 
recreates the features of the original to the best of my ability.

You should be able to download it and install it the same way any 
Lightroom Classic plugins are installed, via `File > Plug-in Manager`,
Command + Option + Shift + `,` (comma) on MacOS, 
or Ctrl + Alt + Shift + `,` (comma) on Windows
